Mermaid
=======

Mermaid allows creation of `Mermaid <https://mermaid.js.org>`__ charts and diagrams in PHP.

The Mermaid package is a dependency of Mermaid chart and diagram packages.
It provides:

* enums that are used in your code
* the Mermaid class that provides static functions used in your code
* the base class that all chart and diagrams extend
* traits that chart and diagrams use; the functions they provide are documented in the packages that use them
